Times a way that was today's date Is reform and change how we can make Society better themselves To work together to improve society. When the influence, politicians to better society? That's my idea the best. So our first component to other well maybe kind of walking that way Progressing your partner. 

Correction. So he turned me on to it. Um and A test corrections. Uh, it won't be in the morning next week because I have morning duty but I'm lucky because it's a short week, so I just kind of lucked up with that. Um but yes, I'll give you plenty of time, plenty of opportunity to do that but just one more day and I'll get to as far as the, um, the essay is there, anybody who's still needs to make up the essays? That's great. Okay, let me give you the outline to let you take a look at it. And then, let me take attendance and we'll get to work. Here Are part of teaching is testing really boring, You know, my in my ideal teaching world, everything would just be passed out. 

Okay, so once you get the outline, please go ahead and take a look at it. 

That's why you keep. 

7:22 AM

I've just discussing very briefly with being in this morning about like chronology design, period Progressive. There is no really good. Start date to it Uh, in the textbooks. I typically see 1900, it's arbitrary. It's not really, it's not like all of a sudden, snap Progressive movement began there In 1917. Why U.S entry into the first world war? Um when we enter The first world war like the Civil War, it really brings perform and change almost to a summary Hall because the American people and politicians are not thinking about how we can improve society. The focus becomes more singular, How we can win a war how we can prepare for, how can we effectively fight the war and how we could win it. So 1917 does represent a fixed state at the end but in many ways so many of the goals of the progressive Movement were already achieved. Also the war brought to fruition to completion. Two of the most important reform movements which were prohibition the move into end, alcohol, or to ban alcohol, which was an enormous failure. Uh, and the second of course, be success is the 19th Amendment. So, in many ways that conservative moment, brought toruition two of the most important goals of the war. So if you um, if you've kind of scanned this outline we start with some decentral beliefs, tenants are beliefs, Some of the tactics And then we will look at today. I don't know if we get that second one we certainly do the first one which is women's suffrage. Suffrage is a fancy word for the right to vote very important. If you're not familiar with some of these words or not putting them on here, just to be uh, you know frivolous. But these are the kind of words you will see on exams and of course, there is no explanation for it. There's no opportunity to explain it On the back side of the outline. The second is African-Americans, which the progressive Movement. Um, you know, the majority of the country being white, Only had limited interests and advocacy for African Americans. So what African-Americans did was they didn't look to white people for help. They looked within their community. So uh, Progressivism and of course, will introduce WBE device who's a very, very important figure. And one of the most important civil rights leaders, and one of the greatest Scholars in American history. So he's kind of two full, but we'll get to that moment. Let's go back to the beginning, Central tenants and Central beliefs. And you can see. I've got nine, there's probably more. The basic one is a society can be improved. It can be improved in two ways, one people coming together, that's known as Grassroots movements, Okay? To make a sense of what a Grassroots movement is. I know I mentioned it in the last couple weeks. Let's see. Give me some modern current today. Grassroots movements. Grassroots is Ordinary People. The bottom, the Grassroots come together, Over an issue or an issue to try to make a change. And how are they going to achieve change By organizing and by having by large organization, raising money influencing political leaders, sometimes they aren't going to look to politically. So, let's see. Can you name any Grassroots movements that have merged? Why don't we just say the 21st century? Oh it's not that hard. Don't think too deep. Do you want to hit as early? George Floyd Done help. Which stands for There you go. Black lives matter. What's black lives matter? All really about? Well yeah, black lives matter. Yes, it's a nice slogan and all that, but let's kind of deconstruct it. Plus brutality Police brutality that certainly has occurred. There have been many victims But now with technology a whole lot more, now we see it firsthand. You know, Videos actual pictorial version. Not people say, oh the police stop me and they beat me up. It's like, oh yeah, prove it. Let me see it. Um, but now we do have the evidence of it. And we saw George, Floyd murder By Minneapolis police officers over a space of what was it, approximately eight minutes video played over and over. Does anybody know where it began the term black lives matter? The movement did not exist but what's the first two sep technology that proved visually Of what police do? Sometimes to African Americans On a very basic, stop on a highway. I'm going to tell you was the 19 92, 92 or 93. I'm going to go with 92. It resulted in massive riots in Los Angeles. Does anybody know what I'm looking for? Here It is Rodney King. Absolutely. And you know how it happened. Rodney King has stopped by the uh, California Highway Patrol which is their state police. Another motor is notices that and they take out one of those old camcorders which is probably in the Attic or the basement which nobody ever uses which was kind of like a. It was a big breakthrough in technology because Home Videos used to be Super 8 cameras. Uh, the film was super eight and maybe you've seen some of these old things and it's like very jittery and there's no sound and it's black and white. Then eventually color it was replaced by these camcorders, which were way better, gave way better visuals. Um, And nowadays people just use their cell phones and is way better, but a motor is stopped and film. The whole thing Sent it to the TV news every night, it was playing on TV, where this brutal beating of this black motorist who was stopped and that was in many ways, the Watershed starting point, just like school shooting school shootings and school. Murders have been around a long time but the beginning one was 19. Again Either 89, I think 90 it was in a town that I lived in at an early college called Simon's Rock, which actually was closing in this spring and it was a student who had mail ordered a whole bunch of like high power guns and he basically shot up against in many ways that scene is the birth of the modern school shooting. Even though there's school shootings and murders that go way back. Um, so yes technology and that's a good example. How about one more? One more. Modern one. I'll give you. I'll try to help you out. Uh, let's see. He's in jail. Thankfully and he's a huge was what are the most prominent Hollywood producers. Producers are money. People. You got it. Twice, Meet the medium movement. Yes, it is. The metoo movement, and the producer was Harvey Weinstein. And he's in jail now. And oh, he used the old-fashioned. The term was called the casting couch. Oh, that goes way back in the history of Hollywood. In other words the interview would happen on the casting catch. Not you know like a screen interview. And in other words, these big powerful producers would make these young, uh, women's stars if they Provided, Uh, if they provided other things. And yes, the need to movement and what happened there. And that was actually, that was started again by an African-American woman named Toronto Burke, uh, who is from some Alabama and what it did was, it inspired by having high profile and now famous actresses coming forth and say, yeah, I was victimized by that. What that does is it creates the Grassroots movement that inspires other women to come forward. And by going public, it's saying not ashamed of it. I'm a victim of it. And an inspires others and it creates a movement. It brings people together So two good examples and I'm sure they're we have many, many others, but those are two examples of it. Uh, that's a Grassroots moving. So hopefully that helps in terms of understanding it, and then Grassroots movement will become active sometimes the local and or state and or national level to influence, politicians, because we had this thing called democracy. And now with the 19th Amendment with women, gaining the right to vote Votes influence politicians, politicians are really simple people, they're not complicated. They go where the votes go, if they're no votes there, They don't talk and advocate for those things. It's simple. And where the votes are often is worth. The money is not money getting to Legally because campaigns are very, very expensive. Okay. So moving on, In the progressive Era, in like all reform years, not everything is perfect. Sometimes their limitations to progressive reform, And in the progressive Era. Yeah, there was a whole lot of nativism and racism too. It wasn't the overwhelming component of it, but it was a factor and here we use Which I introduce to you before, like everybody said, Spencer question, people didn't like that. One number 35, I think Put it on the board. I mentioned Herbert, Spencer, Madison Grant, tough question. But yeah, Urban Spencer was the Eugenesis. Yeah, kind of a not the greatest question in the world but still I guess not unfair and he's an example of science, science and quotations. In other words pseudoscience on the more positive side they really did believe that could be a scientific answer. So what I mean by progressives in science is study the problem, Describe the problem, and that's not good enough. Then come up with a solution and that's the classic thing. In any Progressive movement, Age of reform, before the Civil War progress, severe Circle late 19th century. 19th and the American Civil rights move in 1950s and 60s, you know, massive movements that inspired many others. So This use of science, it was just a popular theme as science started to come of age gained maturity at the University level because during this time period is when we're first going to start seeing graduate programs Johns. Hopkins very, very famous school. Outside of Baltimore is going to be the first major university to start getting advanced degrees. We're going to get a president, the last of the three Progressive year presidents, who's going to get his Doctrine at Johns Hopkins. And that's where Wilson before that Advanced degrees, you know, college, uh University. The only difference in college University has graduate programs college focuses in undergraduate. That's the historical difference between the two. Doesn't mean college is lesser. I know some people think it does, but it's not true. So, smaller schools focus on undergraduates, like the one I went to or like an Amherst College, those small kind of colleges focus on undergraduate. They may have a few graduate programs. So this whole notion of science spawned by the universities, some of it being pseudo. 

7:33 AM
So this whole notion of science spawned by the universities, some of it being pseudo. 

7:33 AM
So this whole notion of science spawned by the universities, some of it being pseudo, But Well-Intioned. And some of it also making sense just like our elective sociology. This is when sociology will come of age during the progress of your sociology, is the study of groups of people. Psychology also will come a big chair Women's suffrage. Yes, women's right to vote very important. And that grows out of the age of reform movement, the Seneca Falls Movement, African Americans reform. As I mentioned buying for African-Americans What progressives did assist oftentimes using money Hbcus or entirely financed and found it by a wealthy white money from up north. Many of these people were kind of either the children or if they were old enough, go back to the abolitionist. Um, so that was the root of a lot of hbcu money, or all of it really African-Americans, have the money really to start their own colleges. So they would look to white for anthropists. Oh, I've got an amazing novel for you And I I don't suspect you have any time to read it now. But especially after you finish the course it is, a really important novel. It's called invisible, Man. Not the invisible Man. The science fiction one By H.G Wells. The British science fiction writer but invisible Man. By Ralph Ellison, Focus published in 1940 Circa 1940, Meaning about that time. Um an invisible man is an enormous week through American history out. Rough Ellison is one of the really, really important. African-American writers of the 20th century. Only finished one novel. Only wrote one novel And yet he's considered a really amazing writerary. He did a lot of non-fiction. He was such a perfectionist, probably had a lot of obsessive compulsiven disorder. A great degree of it could not finish another novel. I guess he was too much of perfectionist, but you know what? You could be considered a great novelist if you only produce, what novel, if it's a really great one, Can you name? So I think some of you write an eighth grade can your name an author who only wrote one novel? It's not Tuesdays Thursday. Um, We've only wrote one novel in her lifetime and I bet some of you read it in ninth grade. It's also a really important reflection Up the Jim Crow South in the early 20th century. 

You read it. Some of you read it. Come on. Somebody said It's to kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. She only wrote one novel? Why is she considered great? Well you could. You could write 20 novels. If they're met, you're not as great as somebody who wrote one novel. That's amazing. And that's what she did. And it's just like, Ellison. Anyway, Ralph Ellison in this novel. Uh, it starts off In Harlem, Around the time of the Harlem, Renaissance, 1920s topic coming up, and he wins a scholarship And he goes down south and it's a fictionalized version of Booker T Washington, instead his last name is Bledso, you know, Charles Dickens, the great 19th century. British writer was a master of creating names That reflected the characteristics of the character. Is anybody read the contemporary novel? I just finished it by Barbara King Solver called Demon Copperhead. Heard of it. Put it on your list for the summer telling you. Um it's a, it's a really, really interesting novel. Um, and what she did in Demon copperhead, is she took a few of the famous, Dickens novels, including David Copperfield is one of his magma best and she used some of the characters that she put in Appalachia Appalachia being like a hard-bitten section of Kentucky and it's um like it's late. I think it depicts late 19th, early 20th century and early 21st century and is the whole opioid epidemic, the lack of homes lack of jobs this sense of loss of focus and all that in this community and how hard didn't it? Is Um, so nobody's read Dickens. David Copperfield, One of the shamarmeius characters in it and his name is Uriah Heap. So, you know, if anybody calls you or I deep that means you're like of low character. And in the novel, you're right. Heap is U-Haul. Piles You hold files. But anyway, Yeah, you'd have to read but anyway, going back to uh, Allison's invisible Man. As it connects to HBCU's. Is that the white philanthropists many of them while? Well intention, Um in many ways unfairly and negatively influenced the direction of these hbcus but nevertheless, their money was instrumental. We've got to move From temperance to prohibition, Temper to reduce, prohibition to ban. Um, so whereas Temperance was the most popular movement in the age of reform, now it's going to grow and it never stopped and it's going to morph into prohibition. Does anybody remember, the Native is component of the temperance movement? Which will connect to prohibition, Want three for three. Go ahead. Basically, I wouldn't be like drunkenness because they would fighting so like obviously you don't want to be like Absolutely and Irish Germans. And, of course, now that we're gonna have more Catholics coming Polish Gothic Italian Catholics and also Jews too. So, in many ways, the prohibition movement, while I think nobly motivated has a very, very strong nativist component, Onward, moral reform, that was code word for anti-prostitution or anti-sex work. The reason why moral form really explode is because the urbanization You see sex work has been around for a long time but what's in a rural area is not in your face. It's When it's in an urban area, it literally is right there. In other words in the lower East side Of Manhattan Tournament departments, teaming streetscapes, you saw those images. I showed you Sex workers in the good weather would lead the building, the brothel, the House of prostitution and be on the sidewalks and families are walking by baby carrots and all that. And they're soliciting the men. So it was more in your face. And that also was what motivated moral reform too. And of course, as I said, there's always here's a racist element. I mentioned, Jack Johnson. Um, when we did a little bit of like Leisure and sports, the famous boxing champion. Uh, why did the government go after him? Because he had a white wife and they went after him. Using the man act, which I don't know. If you've done the reading yet, I guess I didn't say it's due until tomorrow, perhaps, but you'll see it in that first section. The man act is uh it was sponsored, man. M-a-n-n, probably out. German name, Um, and he was a member of Congress and he put forth a piece of legislation, which passed that if you cross state lines with a woman for immoral purposes, then that's a violation of the man act. And that's what they used to go after Jack Johnson even though it was his wife. So yes, there was always sometimes, there is an underbelly to reform movements Education reform. John Dewey is the main man, Who's the guy in the age of reform. We're in a time where it's not bad to double back To And it's not the Dewey decimal system but nobody knows that anymore. Anyhow um who is the main guy in education reform in the age of reform, Just as a review question because these names don't open appear in exams Horse, man. That's right. Yes, another German American. No doubt. And yeah, famous novelist post-war novel, German novels probably the most famous one Thomas Mount. His name is famous novels of Magic Mountain. But John Dewey John Dewey, his ideas about education reform are many fold. But one of them is get all these immigrants of this country. How are we going to Americanize them? How are we getting Americanize? It we're going to put a flag in every classroom. We're going to do a salute to the flag every morning. We're going to pledge every morning and then we're going to create a curriculum. That inculcates the values of American history and American democracy Into the curriculum. And that's so, I guess, if you could say, why do we have to study US History in US government? Why is it mandatory in the state of Georgia? Uh, if you don't like it, don't blame me. I'm just trying to make a living. It's John Dewey, John Dewey did it. He did it. I didn't do it. So Yes, that's education, reform, public schools, American values. And lastly, in terms of central belief Central tenants using laws legislation at the state level of the national level, using the courts at the state level, the national level to achieve reform goals. Um so yes it's a multifaceted movement. That involves many different groups. Um and with a variety of tactics, Well onward, detective some mukbaker journalism. This is a term that had introduced before we see it in a variety of ways, political cartoons, for example, we've seen numerous ones of those like the famous one Of about bosses of the Senate, the Kepler won. I showed it to you when we studied that, Uh, and about the interest and then the mooraka piece from the Sunday Morning Show, same image, you know, using these kind of exaggerated imagery to kind of connect to the public. Maybe a public that is not overly literate, or just not want to read multi-collums about, you know, the evils of the interest. Just look at the cartoon tells you everything you need to know, Maybe a bit of hyperbole, no doubt. But yeah, political cartoons novels another big theme and I think I mentioned, Upton Sinclair, and Theodore dryer. These were the Masters Masters crappy writers, yeah. From a literary perspective. Not good writers but it didn't matter Didn't really care. What they cared about is Driving home, a message driving home, a message was more important than creating a literary Masterpiece. So when the literature people, my wife being one of them, I think when I did the American studies with her for many years of gsmst and I can answer, we got to read the jungle Up In Sinclair and her response was the guys like the crappiest, right or ever why I can't teach that in English classes, but it really squares. Well with so many themes in U.S history. Many many themes. Um, Yeah, and she agreed. But of course, I had to do a better job with Gatsby on the history end of it. So there was a trade-off, I'm not, it's not about uh, bullying my wife into doing something. She didn't want to do, and yes, it does. Tell sort of a sappy story, novels magazines, became very popular and there were magazine just dedicated to muckriker journalism. Probably the most famous one is a McClure's. 

7:44 AM
Probably the most famous one is a McClure's. 

7:44 AM
Is why I'm writing is on board. I hope you're writing them too. McClure's magazine. It's no posture because And who's a guy by the last name McClure? Who did it, McClure's magazine. So when you see an attribution like on a dbq, a document says, McClure's magazine, It says mcclures Before you even read the document, you should instantly know Mukbreaker journalism immediately, I really want you to always look at the attributions, in other words who wrote it, who drew it. So for cartoons, our big guys are Kepler and Thomas Nast. Whenever you see a master or Kepler, cartoon political cartoon immediately, what it's going to be. I'm upbreaker reform. Dedicated to reform, What other things were used magazines newspapers. Of course, novels The ballot, One of the tactics is if we can increase democracy, get more people to vote or make more people eligible vote. We can achieve these objectives of progressive reform Unions taking on the interest. That's right. Well, we saw their emergence in the late 19th century. First of the nights, then the American Federation of Labor. And with little exception, they lost strike. After strike the two, most infamous Strikes of the late. 19th century, the Pullman strike in Chicago, Led by Eugene, Victor Debs, it was incarcerated for leading the movement and of course, the strike at Homestead, the homestead Factory Carnegie steel, where many workers were beaten and killed. I mean they could be considered massive losses But the unions state. They they they remained intact To fight another day and buy their early 20th century and by 1934, they will achieve all the objectives and more that those Union leaders of the 19th century could a dream about. So yes to create greater fairness. In fact, we could thank unions and the union efforts of the late 19th and early 20th century for the workplaces of today. For example. Um, Let's take fast food in many jobs. And I'm speaking really to the uh the young women in this class Um, sometimes and especially restaurants are pretty predatory places they are. And it's like one of the first great life lessons for many that you really will experience sexual harassment. You will, it's a fact that's the reason why don't, I can't say it particularly like the politics of the ownership of Chick-fil-A. I really do respect the company because They have much, much better workplace practices. I've never heard of, of all the, the young women I've taught when they work at Chick-fil-A. They never give me horror stories about sexual harassment, but women to work at McDonald's and stuff like, yes, it's constant, but there is a recourse there are laws against it. There's an Avenue to pursue and that is all because of the progressive Era. Just being one example of what we experienced today. Even uh, the decline of unions in many ways. The cause of the decline of unions is the interest capitalists. Just gotten smarter. You don't need to brutalize workers. You can get more out of workers if you just act. Nice, If you're kinder. If you give them benefits, if you care about them in many ways, that's another component of the Union victory. Is that employers just got smarter? You know, the first one you really got smart And he's a very unsavory character. We hold him up as American hero, I'm sorry. I just can't get down with nativists and anti-semites and that's Henry Ford. Yeah. The Henry. Ford bad man. But What he did in the 19, uh, in the teens with his company, He doubled the wage of his average, the average worker be double per hour of what anybody in any other Market would do. He realize I cannot you need the unions. What do unions produce? What is the goal for unions debtor wages? Watch this. I'm going to give you better ways. Now I'm going to get a better Workforce And it was smart unlike those 19th century industrious, you know, so what you're a good worker. I've got all these workers out here, you're replaceable. You're like a Coggin and a machine. You're an interchangeable part. We could throw you away. Um, But they got smarter Capital, they realized you don't need to be heavy-handed. You don't need to be that way. You can achieve your objectives of profitability. Um and profitability through having a better trained Workforce greater quality. If you just act a little bit humane and by giving more money to the workers, he was able to get the best class of workers, But of course, the other genius of Henry Ford was He also now that they make enough money. Now they could buy his cars And they did And in addition he would sell them cars and he would take it out the money from their paychecks. So not only they're making more money, they're happy. And then they have a car which they've ever had before. But meanwhile, he's selling more cars and he's got greater profitability and that was a model that a lot of the other capitalists followed. So as far as the other stuff, well what are you gonna do? You know, there are still Jews today, who won't buy forwards because of Henry, Ford there tend to be old-timers but yeah, because of what Ford really meant. In terms of that uh his anti-Semitism onward Grassroots organization did that already. Okay, women's soccer. How are we doing? We're doing Antibellum roots. Yes, we know, agent reforms, Seneca Falls Convention. Some of the veterans of the Seneca Falls Convention will be moving into the end. Uh, the the suffrage movement of the uh, the mid really the late 19th century. So obviously some of these were younger And a lot of these women live long lives. Uh, the first emergence was the American women's suffrage Association, which went by the acronym Assa They're established in 1869 four years after the Civil War, and they have very, very close ties to the Republican Party. The Republican party Much more so. Well yeah, was the party If the two parties was much stronger in support of women's suffrage, which means down here the solid South women suffrage movement was behind the rest of the country because of the control of Democrats. Also, in the Northeast and the Midwest, the Industrial cities Women's suffrage. Among Democrats was not as strong because of the traditional values of many of these immigrant families. Um, we see that even too dead. We see that, I'm sure represented in our school in this classroom about how sometimes in among certain immigrant groups and immigrant culture. They have different ideas about women's rights. For example, I've got a former student I think I shared with the Sarah Kang. She's a professor at Princeton University. Yeah, I should very, very impressive. Um, she did uh, did I tell you about Sarah? She was um, what's that famous scholarship? I wrote it. A million letters for Quest bridge bus bridge. If you've heard of that one, it's dedicated for students who are from low-income families, their income thresholds. But very, very high achieving and it's one of the greatest programs in the country because it's for your college free And it's a matching system. So, if your family makes has a gross income gross meaning before taxes, I think the threshold is sixty thousand, a mighty change. It's been a few years since I've done it. Obviously, I didn't write too many college recommendations that give I told you about. The one Rec I wrote didn't, I Didn't tell you about the one rack. I wrote it to the judge That that he's, you know, going to school regularly and he's trying hardens performing his life And he got his ankle bracelet taken off. You don't even know about an actual bracelets, the monitors and all that. I don't think it was my letter. I really don't think it was my letter, but it was the one recommendation I wrote. Um, so I had a Hiatus for three years. We'll talk about recommendations later on. Um, Because I have a feeling I'm going to be bludging Anyway. 

Well onward. Um, so yes. Close association of the Republican Party. They're tactics State working at the state and local level. They thought it would just be two grand tactically to try to Lobby means influence Congress. The president to gain women's suffrage. So they started off small working on local politicians of the local level. Like for example, our local politicians here are Gwinnett County government Uh Gwinnett County School Board, You don't follow anything. Here are school board politics. What happened to your? Well I guess we could say our he's my employer too Calvin Watts, he's gone. Yeah, as Donald Trump once said, in his reality TV show, it is best Queen's accent. You fire, That means you're fired. Um Charlie I grew up around uh you know working class in New Yorkers. I really have that working class New York accent down. I grew up around it. It's loud, it's crass. It's not very friendly. I could tell you that Like, for example, like uh, when my parents are growing up, if you're being annoying, Uh what's your parents would say to you, why don't you get outside and play in traffic? They really did say it And occasion of my parents would say too except Live in Suburbia and there was no traffic but we're thinking about in the city. There was a lot of traffic. I mean, they might the kids to get hit by traffic, they just wasn't him. Get out of the house and stop being annoying. Yeah. They would say things like that, right? Yeah. Very nice. That's New York. Anyway Um so yeah. Voting rights of State, local level Most touch the Republican Party. They were the more conservative of these women. Rights organizations. Some of the uh tactics they used was testimony before state legislatures. Uh, that's not new. I think the first woman to testify before state legislature was Dorothea Dix in 1843 in Massachusetts. So having the right to speak before the state legislature hearing their voices hearing what their goals and aspirations are What else do we have? Let's see using things like newsletter. So another tactic Uh their leadership was Lucy Stone And a Julia. Ward Howe uh Julie. Ward Howe, let's see. She wrote the battle him of the Republic, which was that song? John Brown's body lies, molding her grave using the same song, but changing the lyrics. And of course in the more modern sense, the University of Georgia Spike saw is the music to the Valhoun Republic. So Julia Ward Howard, Lucy Stone. 

7:55 AM
So Julia Ward Howard, Lucy Stone. 

7:55 AM
So Julia. Ward Howard, Lucy, Stone And Even a man by the name of Henry Blackwell Henry Blackwell was the most prominent man at Seneca Falls. So there were men who actually supported the movement. So that's just a small example, their leadership. And Now the more radical one NASA National Women suffrage Association, What I mean, more radical was their tactics, were much more in your face, Public rallies public protests. And in many ways that copy the tactics that were done by the British suffrage movement British suffragettes, and that's what women who Advocate for. Uh separage are known as supper Jets. Um, the radical tactics in were much more sudden, the United States, but in also copied them, Uh, Don't have exact date. First decade of the night of the 20th century British suffragettes. Uh, decided they were going to protest against the British Parliament's not giving them the right to vote By doing something pretty dramatic In Britain. Their most famous horse races called the Epson Darby, that's Derby. We pronounce a Derby, they pronounce it Darby. But it still spelled derby. Anyway, Epson Darby, which is the equivalent of our Kentucky Derby, a British suffered jet. See there's the horse track around and then the inside as soon as the infield, So some British suffer Jets bought tickets to the infield and one of them decided to hurl or self over the rail, the rail. Where the horse just keeps the horses on the track, Right? Before the king's horse, the horse owned by King, Edward raced on by. She threw herself over the rail And she was killed by the horse. In other words, she killed herself for a political reason. It's not unusual. Did you ever hear of self-emolation For gasoline on you light a match? Uh, that was a tap to commonly used by Buddhist A2 uh protest against American involvement in the Vietnam War, it was done by the Irish in uh to try to get rid of British control. Another version of it is. Um, Uh, starvation is, You know, doing starvation, you know, not eating in prison and ultimately potentially dying if you, uh, if you don't start getting some sustenance. So always to protest, the Americans are, never that radical the most radical nausea. Got was many awesome. Several no, never change themselves to the outside Gates of the White House. So by protesting by practicing civil Disobedience, they were inviting arrest. Kind of like his one day in jail Henry, David Thoreau, or like Gandhi in India, being arrested constantly and beaten. Or for that matter, Those tactics were adopted by the Civil Rights Movement as well. So, in other words using the rest to gain public attention by being political prisoners, and that's what they were. Political prisoners of political prisoner is somebody who's arrested and they've done nothing wrong. Even though Law and Authority says, they're criminal Like a guy who I don't know how he can't win. The Nobel Prize Alexa Navalny, He was the uh, the Russian guy who protested against Vladimir Putin, which is only a very person would possibly do that. He got sent to prison, several times, he was poison nearly to death survived somehow. And then he ends up in a Russian prison, he runs are you wake back there, then he is, uh, he ends up at a Russian prison inside barrier And just last year, they announced he was taking a walk and he dropped dead this. Very strong, man, middle-aged man, you don't drop dead from taking a walk clearly, he was murdered. Um, so, I mean, what bravery? I mean, I wouldn't do it but then I'm not that great but there are people. So, NASA is using those tactics. So again also much more conservative, you know, using newsletters Advocating for women's suffrage at the state and local level, but not using radical tactics and also much more radical, but they merged And the emerge in 1890. So, all sudden also become the national American women's suffrage Association, which I guess we could still call NASA. Not to be confused with NWSA. Their tactics are kind of a merger of what the American women's suffered Association did and natural limit suffers Association. Um when the merger happened There was a Purge, the more radical elements were kind of purged kicked out and they formed what was called the national women's party. The national women's party And their radical leader. Her name is Alice ball, so who was probably the most radical radical? Meaning extreme within the women's suffrage movement? It would be Alice Paul. So the national women's party said, oh no, no yeah, voting rights import but there's a much larger menu of issues confronting women. And there are numerous whether it be the rights in marriage divorce, things like that, Or even the right, and you need to speak candidly here of, you know, rape within marriage, You know, they were actually discussing that 100 years before, that was really discussed publicly. The idea that there can be rape within marriage and that a man could be prosecuted for rape within marriage. You know, for a long time quartz wouldn't accept that. They said they'll such thing. There's no such thing as rape within marriage. So, you know, kind of taking on ideas, which we would really consider to be more of the 1960s 70s and modern women's rights movement. So that's really what the national women's party is kind of a foreshadowing of and they were, they were purged. They were seen as not kind of mainstream enough, the leadership of NASA and probably the woman is the most famous of the suffer Jets is Susan B, Anthony. However, But they also had some of the older leaders. So people like uh Elizabeth he Stanton Who was the leader at Seneca Falls. And Susan Anthony, when you're famous, you get to have the middle initial, It's like, oh, the great Gatsby. That many of you are still reading, He wasn't F, Scott Fitzgerald when he was running. He was Scott Fitzgerald or maybe scumbag or alcoholic or whatever they called him. Yeah, F. Scott Fitzgerald, he dies, he become his famous, all of a sudden you get it initial that happens. A lot of times. Um, Yeah. And there are many, many examples of that. Uh, so yes. Elizabeth Katie Stanton, Lucy Stone. So many of these veterans but the real Elizabeth Katie Stanton was leader at Seneca Falls, The National American colored women. Um, and that was established in 1894 Their tactics. Uh, was equal rights for women. A focus on African-American poverty. So here we see African-American women politicizing but in the age of Jim Crow which is not just north In the north, you're all introduce these terms that you Latin terms in the Racism is de facto In the South. It's du jour, Meaning it's in law. The laws say segregation In the north, it's by practice, it's not in law, but its practice. And what I mean, the difference there, let's go to facto. If you're an African-American and you want to rent an apartment In a white neighborhood, They won't show you the apartment. You go to the real estate office, I like to rent an apartment. I see a for rent, sign in the window or on the building. And I I've got the money, I've got the resources, I want to rent an apartment that building The real estate agent. Would say no. No, You can't rent an apartment that building, We're not gonna even show it to you. Let alone run to you. That's de facto segregation. Or you go and apply for a jobs. You're an African-American physician. Yeah, there were, uh, there were definitely the beginnings of African-American positions and you apply for a job in a hospital that serves, uh, that serves a white people. You won't be interviewed and if you're not interviewed, you can't get the job. That's de facto segregation. Not being able to be arrested for drinking from the white water. Fountain. That's du jour segregation of schools by law. That's du jour. It's in law and to factor segregation in many ways As as many evils as does your segregation. Don't think that was any great thing for black people up north. No no no. The differences and it is a mighty difference. You just don't have lynchings in New Jersey and New York. You're very shall violence, Like, especially during the first world war, these St, Louis race rides. The Pittsburgh race rides is their call or a toso, Oklahoma, but that's sort of a Southern Place. So yeah, we we see racial violence but we don't see this, you know, massive number of lynching The greatest terrorism in the history of our country. Do not occur a 911, The greatest terrorism was American against American and that was Lynching over 5 thousand documented lynchings between year 1870 to, uh, to 1940. Over 5 000, the greatest violence ever again, you know domestic terrorism history of our country and still not fully recognized, but moving along in that direction. Okay. So those are the tactics. Um another thing of tactics And this is also been questioned quite a bit in modern times This notion of being twice as good In many ways this uh the HBCU's Boker T Washington National Association called Women's Believed, one of the ways they can gain respect by larger white society is they need to be twice as good, Twice as smart twice as well, spoken twice as well dressed, and this was very much criticized by more left-wing young uh ink black intellectuals during the Obama presidency that called it. The politics of respectability and they said, oh the Obama is the other successful, you know why they're successful? They played a white people, they they act and play in a way that white people will respect. Now, uh, that's a fringe movement, very much based on University. Like the other day I mentioned, latinx in this class. I was, uh, doing that boring elliptical at the gym, and A woman passed by, and he said, Emery latinx, suddenly want to talk to her about it, but, um, because I told you only two percent of let you know Consider themselves latinx and sure enough, oh, ever University, you know, famous Private universities. Like, Oh, that's a pretty outtouchy. The other thing that's it. I have the issue with the X part is that it's kind of a play on Malcolm X And the whole idea of X you know, unknown right variable unknown. I think most 

8:06 AM
Variable unknown. I think most Lat 

8:06 AM
Variable unknown. I think most Latin Know where they're from Their family here to Mexico. Guatemala Cuba blah, blah, blah. However, when Malcolm X comes along the whole idea of the X, the unknown, he doesn't know where specifically in Africa, he was his ancestors were taken from, that's lost. So I also think the X thing, I guess they're trying to do the acts as it's kind of a gender neutral thing. But the problem is it's kind of almost a misappropriation of the notion of Malcolm X of African-Americans who were stolen from Africa, brought into slavery and then on a specific or the problem hard Americans know where they're from, just like European and Asian immigrants know where they're from. Uh, so yeah, maybe a little bit problematic. Um Leadership. Let's finish that up before we leave Mary Church Terrell? What are the most important African-American leaders and often doesn't get really the The Press of some of the others? Such as two other names. Ida Wells, Id B, Wells, uh was a journalist a Muppet your journalist, most famous for her research and writing about Lynching And yes, Harriet Tubman is still around Harry Tubman live till 1911. I mean, she lived a really, really long life and yeah, you would think like, wow, she's still around and she was also a founding member of the National Association of colored women. Um, and yes, at least with finished his first part racism. Women suffered Associations, Susan. B, Anthony has a statue in Central Park and she's hailed as, you know, probably he can only name one woman, white woman women's suffrage, but she was a racist. And now we know that because of her letters that her correspondence and she sold out African-Americans because, Um, because the National Association of color women did partner with NASA And in the hope that and also would advocate for black voting rights, a Return of the 15th Amendment and to include black women in 19th Amendment, 90 of all black people lived in the old South And listen, five percent of them are able to vote and that was the racism and the abandonment of African-American women, you know, as of these white large, these white organizations specifically for black for their voting rights. They just abandoned black women and for a long time historians and I'm talking about liberal story and humbling. Conservatives. I'm blaming liberals Because these are suffer Jets were held up as being, you know, such great leaders. They basically didn't write about. They just neglected The racism of Susan Anthony. And she really had some very inflammatory, you know, correspondences numerous Where she doesn't really have a highest opinion about black people and that's why there's, you know, you know, you'll cancel culture and all that Tomorrow. We will Movement to get Friday to African-American Progressive. Well, probably have another outline as well, and then we'll look at the spot too. 

Four more days until the winter break, right?
